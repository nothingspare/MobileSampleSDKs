Customers
=================
This API SDK was automatically generated by APIMATIC BETA v2.0

How To Configure:
=================
The generated code might need to be configured with your API credentials. To do that,
open the file "Configuration.h" and edit it's contents.

How To Build: 
=============
The generated code uses two Cocoa Pods namely, JSONModel and UniRest.
Reference to these two is already set in the PodFile, all you need to do is
the following.

    1. Open terminal and goto the unarchived directory.
    2. Run command "pod install" without the quotes. 
    3. A new file named "Customers.xcworkspace" will be created as a result.
    4. Open the "Customers.xcworkspace" in XCode 5.0.
    5. Invoke build command.

How To Use:
===========
The build process generates a static library, which can be used just like an
ordinary static library. See the following link for more information on this
topic.
